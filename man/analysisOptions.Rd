\title{Obtain options to run JASP analyses with.}
\usage{
analysisOptions(source)
}
\arguments{
\item{source}{One of three: (1) R function name, (2) path to .jasp file or (3) json string. See the details section for more information.}
}
\value{
A list containing options of the analysis. If \code{source} is a .jasp file with multiple analyses, then a list of lists.
If \code{source} is the name of the R function of the analysis then all default options have been
filled in and booleans set to FALSE. The options that have no default are
left empty.
}
\description{
\code{analysisOptions} provides an easy way to create analysis options that can be supplied to \code{runAnalysis}.
}
\details{
There are three types of allowed input. 1) The name of the R function of the analysis (case-sensitive); jaspTools will attempt to read the .qml file for that analysis and create a set of default options.
2) the path to .jasp file that has one or more analyses. Or (3) a json string that was sent by the JASP application. This json can be obtained by having JASP log to file (JASP>Preferences>Advanced>Log to file).
The logs can be found by clicking 'Show logs" in the "Logging options". Click on the file "\emph{Engine}.log" that has "Engine::receiveAnalysisMessage:" (usually Engine 1), copy the content between the \{ and \}.
Be sure to use single quotes (') when supplying this string.
